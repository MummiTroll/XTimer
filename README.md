# XTimer
Extended timer and stopwatch with days up and down counter

It is a desktop version of a laboratory timer. Timer mode has set (“hour”,”min”,”sec”), “Start/Stop” and “Clear” buttons and three small windows for quick timer setting. “Days count” is a version of the timer for counting days, up and down.

Typing the name of the process in the box above the screen allows to get a synthesized voice speaking this name as ringtone. If the box is empty, the timer takes a ringtone from the list. The list of ringtones is available in the settings panel.

The timer setting or the stopwatch begin time values are remembered for the case of Stand By activation. After the reactivation of the PC, the timer automatically reactivates the running timer/stopwatch and adjusts the time values for the Stand By break.

If additioinal copies of the timer are opened, each of them creates its own SettingsN.ini file.

XTimer is placed in the directory: Drive:\_TimerX\
Subdirectories: 
for ringtone *.mp3 or *wav files: Drive:\_TimerX\Alarm\
for the settings file: Drive:\_TimerX\Settings\
